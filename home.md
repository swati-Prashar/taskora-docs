## From Code to Content: A Software Engineer's Journey into Writing

Hi, I’m **Swati Prashar**! For the past 7 years, I’ve been deep into software development, writing code, solving technical problems, and building systems. But along the way, I realized that I enjoyed something else too—explaining complex technical ideas in simple, clear ways.

That’s how I leaped from coding to technical writing. Now, instead of just building software, I help others understand it through API documentation, setup guides, and all kinds of technical content.

By using the **Docs-as-Code** approach, I ensure my documentation is clean, organized, and easy to update—just like the way I manage code. I also use **GitLab CI/CD** to automate the deployment process, keeping everything efficient and up-to-date.

I believe that good writing isn’t just about words; it’s about making technical concepts accessible to everyone. Feel free to explore my portfolio and see how I combine my coding expertise with my passion for writing to create content that’s clear and helpful.
