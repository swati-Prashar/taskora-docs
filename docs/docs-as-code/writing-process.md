# 🧭 Writing Process / Docs-as-Code

This section explains how I used a Docs-as-Code approach to create Taskora documentation.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- GitHub (repo management, commits, branches)
- GitBook (live publishing and UI layer)
- Markdown (content format)
- VS Code (editor)

## 🔁 Process Steps
1. Created Markdown files for each documentation section
2. Used Git branches to isolate changes
3. Committed updates with clear messages
4. Synced GitHub repo with GitBook
5. Simulated reviews through PRs (pull requests)
6. Tracked progress using Jira tickets

## ✅ Benefits
- Full version history of documentation
- Consistent writing and structure via templates
- Developer-friendly workflow
- Realistic simulation of industry-standard practices
