# How I Built Taskora Docs

> 🚀 A behind-the-scenes look at how I built a complete technical documentation project using real tools, a Docs-as-Code workflow, and product-thinking principles.

## 🔧 Why I Built It

As a **developer-turned-technical writer**, I wanted to do more than submit writing samples. I wanted to **simulate a real-world documentation workflow** — the kind companies expect when hiring a technical writer. That meant building an internal tool (Taskora) and documenting it from the ground up with proper version control, ticketing, structure, and publishing in mind.

## 🧱 My Stack

- **GitHub** — Version control for all Markdown docs  
- **GitBook** — Hosted user-facing documentation portal  
- **Jira** — Documentation tickets, epics, and sprint planning  
- **Confluence** — Planning pages, internal wiki, and style guide notes  
- **GitLab CI/CD (Planned)** — To auto-lint Markdown and enable continuous deployment

---

## 🗂 How I Structured the Docs

- Sidebar navigation grouped by documentation type: installation, usage, updates, APIs, troubleshooting  
- Clean file structure using folders (e.g., `/docs/installation/`, `/docs/api-docs/`)  
- Reusable patterns across pages (headings, callouts, code blocks, tips)  
- Summary and landing page written in a conversational, human-centered tone  

---

## 🧭 Docs-as-Code Workflow

- Wrote all docs in **Markdown locally**  
- Used **Git** for version control and branching  
- Committed and pushed updates to **GitHub**  
- Connected GitHub with **GitBook** for live publishing  
- Tracked documentation tasks using **Jira** (epics, features, bugs)  
- Documented the entire workflow in `writing-process-docs-as-code.md`

## 🏁 What I Learned

- Clear structure matters as much as clear writing  
- Even a dummy product can become a powerful demo of process mastery  
- Technical writing isn't just writing — it’s **information design**, **collaboration**, and **iteration**
