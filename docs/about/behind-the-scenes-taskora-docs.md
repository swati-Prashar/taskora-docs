# 🛠️ How I Built Taskora Docs

**Taskora Docs** is more than just a dummy project—it's a hands-on simulation of what real-world technical writing looks like. This section gives you a peek behind the scenes at the tools, thought process, and execution that went into building this portfolio from scratch.

## 💭 The Vision

I wanted to go beyond writing samples and create a **complete technical documentation ecosystem**—one that mirrors what a technical writer does in a product-based team. That meant:

- Planning like a PM  
- Structuring like an IA specialist  
- Writing like a documentation expert  
- Using tools like a real-world Agile team

## 🧰 Tools I Used

| Tool       | Purpose                                                        |
|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Jira**   | Created Epics, Stories, and Tasks to plan documentation modules |
| **GitBook**| Hosted the live docs and structured pages for maximum readability |
| **GitHub** | Maintained Markdown files and version-controlled documentation  |
| **Confluence** | Simulated internal collaboration and decision logs         |
| **Markdown** | Used for clean, semantic content writing                    |
| **Git**    | Tracked changes, commits, and issue linkage                   |
| **ChatGPT**| Used as a writing assistant to brainstorm, refine, and rephrase |

## 📋 My Workflow

1. **Ideation & Planning**  
   Created the dummy product idea “Taskora”—a task management tool—and documented product goals, target audience, and feature list.

2. **Agile Planning**  
   Built a project backlog in **Jira** with Epics like Installation, User Guide, API Docs, etc., and broke them down into actionable tickets.

3. **Docs-as-Code Setup**  
   Linked my GitHub repo to GitBook and began writing each document in **Markdown**, using semantic tags, symbols, and consistent formatting.

4. **Live Publishing & Version Control**  
   Used Git to push updates and tracked progress. Implemented changelogs and status badges.

5. **Design & IA Decisions**  
   Structured content into modules, prioritized readability, added onboarding pages, and created a logical documentation flow.

6. **Review & Polish**  
   Rewrote multiple drafts, simplified language, refined tone, and ensured everything was **clear, concise, and user-focused**.

## ✅ What I Did Myself

- Product concept, design, and architecture  
- Jira planning and ticket creation  
- GitHub setup, repo management, and commits  
- GitBook publishing, formatting, and IA  
- Writing and editing every doc (ChatGPT was used as an assistant only)  
- Tool integration and documentation strategy  
- Visual assets such as badges and cover image design

## 🔍 Why This Matters

This project demonstrates not just my ability to write—but to **think like a product team member**, organize and manage content, troubleshoot technical issues, and bring a complex documentation system to life from scratch.
