# ðŸ“˜ About

Hi, Iâ€™m **Swati Prashar**, a frontend developer turned technical writer with 8+ years of experience in software development. While I havenâ€™t held a formal tech writing title yet, my background in building and shipping products gives me a strong foundation in creating accurate, developer-focused documentation.

Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve worked closely with SMEsâ€”often being one myselfâ€”and have mentored junior developers, reviewed technical work, and clarified complex systems. In fact, in my last role, I voluntarily created and maintained our internal code setup documentation. It originally took new developers up to four days (and multiple calls to senior engineers) just to get their systems up and running. I saw the gap, wrote clear setup docs, and made onboarding dramatically smoother. That experience sparked my interest in technical writing.

As my family responsibilities have grown, especially with a young child, Iâ€™ve stepped back from full-time development but stayed close to tech. I leaned into what Iâ€™ve always enjoyed: explaining complex things clearly. Technical writing isnâ€™t just a fitâ€”itâ€™s a natural extension of what Iâ€™ve already been doing.

To demonstrate this, I built **Taskora**â€”a dummy internal task management productâ€”to simulate real-world documentation workflows. I used a **Docs-as-Code** approach with **GitBook, GitLab CI/CD, Jira, and Confluence**, writing everything from installation guides to troubleshooting documents.

Feel free to explore my portfolio and see how I combine my coding expertise with my passion for writing to create content thatâ€™s clear and helpful.
